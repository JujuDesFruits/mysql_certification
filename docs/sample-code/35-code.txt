Chapter 35 Securing the MySQL Installation

Unless you see a USE statement for a different database,
assume for SQL statements that the world database has
been selected as the default database.

Some examples are preceded by additional statements
that do not appear in the printed study guide.  For
example, a CREATE TABLE statement may be preceded by a
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statement to make sure that the
table created by the CREATE TABLE statement does not
already exist, or a SELECT statement that displays
sample data may be preceded by statements that create
and populate the table.

35.3 Filesystem Security

chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql
chgrp -R mysql /usr/local/mysql

chmod u=rwx,go=rx /usr/local/mysql
chmod u=rwx,go=rx /usr/local/mysql/bin
chmod u=rwx,go-rwx /usr/local/mysql/libexec
chmod -R go-rwx /usr/local/mysql/data

chown mysql /etc/my.cnf
chgrp mysql /etc/my.cnf
chmod u=rw,go=r /etc/my.cnf

chmod u=rw,go-rwx ~/.my.cnf

35.5.1 Securing the Initial MySQL Accounts

In the following example, make these substitutions: 
- Replace rootpass with the root password
- Replace host_name with a hostname

mysqladmin -u root password 'rootpass'
mysqladmin -u root -h host_name password 'rootpass'

mysql -u root mysql

In the following example, make this substitution: 
- Replace rootpass with the root password

UPDATE user SET Password = PASSWORD('rootpass')
WHERE User = 'root';

DELETE FROM user
WHERE User = 'root' AND Host = '%';

DELETE FROM user WHERE User = '';
DELETE FROM db WHERE User = '';

SELECT Host, User, Password FROM user;

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

35.5.2 General Privilege Precautions

SELECT Host, User FROM user WHERE Password = '';

35.6 FEDERATED Table Security

CREATE TABLE FedCity
(
    ID          INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name        CHAR(35) NOT NULL,
    CountryCode CHAR(3) NOT NULL,
    District    CHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    Population  INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
)
ENGINE=FEDERATED
COMMENT='mysql://wuser:wpass@world.example.com/world/City';

UPDATE user SET Password = PASSWORD('rootpass')
WHERE User = 'root';
DELETE FROM user
WHERE User = 'root' AND Host = '%';
DELETE FROM user WHERE User = '';
DELETE FROM db WHERE User = '';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


SELECT * FROM user
WHERE User = '' OR Password = '';
