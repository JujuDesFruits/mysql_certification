Chapter 42 Scaling MySQL

Unless you see a USE statement for a different database,
assume for SQL statements that the world database has
been selected as the default database.

Some examples are preceded by additional statements
that do not appear in the printed study guide.  For
example, a CREATE TABLE statement may be preceded by a
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statement to make sure that the
table created by the CREATE TABLE statement does not
already exist, or a SELECT statement that displays
sample data may be preceded by statements that create
and populate the table.

42.2.1 Setting Up Replication

In the following example, make these substitutions: 
- Replace slave_user with the slave username
- Replace slave_host with the slave hostname
- Replace slave_pass with the slave password

CREATE USER 'slave_user'@'slave_host' IDENTIFIED BY 'slave_pass';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'slave_user'@'slave_host';

In the following example, make these substitutions: 
- Replace master_host_name with the master hostname
- Replace slave_user with the slave username
- Replace slave_pass with the slave password
- Replace master_log_file with the master log filename
- Replace master_log_pos with the master log file position

CHANGE MASTER TO
MASTER_HOST = 'master_host_name',
MASTER_USER = 'slave_user',
MASTER_PASSWORD = 'slave_pass',
MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'master_log_file',
MASTER_LOG_POS = master_log_pos;
