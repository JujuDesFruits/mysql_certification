Chapter 41 Optimizing the Environment

Unless you see a USE statement for a different database,
assume for SQL statements that the world database has
been selected as the default database.

Some examples are preceded by additional statements
that do not appear in the printed study guide.  For
example, a CREATE TABLE statement may be preceded by a
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statement to make sure that the
table created by the CREATE TABLE statement does not
already exist, or a SELECT statement that displays
sample data may be preceded by statements that create
and populate the table.

CREATE TABLE t (i INT)
DATA DIRECTORY = '/var/mysql-alt/data/test'
INDEX DIRECTORY = '/var/mysql-alt/data/test';
