Chapter 17 Prepared Statements

Unless you see a USE statement for a different database,
assume for SQL statements that the world database has
been selected as the default database.

Some examples are preceded by additional statements
that do not appear in the printed study guide.  For
example, a CREATE TABLE statement may be preceded by a
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statement to make sure that the
table created by the CREATE TABLE statement does not
already exist, or a SELECT statement that displays
sample data may be preceded by statements that create
and populate the table.

17.2 Using Prepared Statements from the mysql Client

PREPARE my_stmt FROM
'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM CountryLanguage WHERE CountryCode = ?';

SET @code = 'ESP'; EXECUTE my_stmt USING @code;

SET @code = 'RUS'; EXECUTE my_stmt USING @code;

DEALLOCATE PREPARE my_stmt;

17.3 Preparing a Statement

PREPARE namepop FROM '
SELECT Name, Population
FROM Country
WHERE Code = ?
';

PREPARE error FROM '
SELECT NonExistingColumn
FROM Country
WHERE Code = ?
';

17.4 Executing a Prepared Statement

PREPARE namepop FROM '
SELECT Name, Population
FROM Country
WHERE Code = ?
';

SET @var1 = 'USA';

EXECUTE namepop USING @var1;

SET @var2 = 'GBR';

EXECUTE namepop USING @var2;

SELECT @var3 := 'CAN';

EXECUTE namepop USING @var3;

EXECUTE namepop USING @var4;

17.5 Deallocating Prepared Statements

DEALLOCATE PREPARE namepop;
