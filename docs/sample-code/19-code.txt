Chapter 19 Triggers

Unless you see a USE statement for a different database,
assume for SQL statements that the world database has
been selected as the default database.

Some examples are preceded by additional statements
that do not appear in the printed study guide.  For
example, a CREATE TABLE statement may be preceded by a
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statement to make sure that the
table created by the CREATE TABLE statement does not
already exist, or a SELECT statement that displays
sample data may be preceded by statements that create
and populate the table.

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Capital;
CREATE TABLE Capital
SELECT Country.Name AS Country, City.Name AS Capital,
City.Population
FROM Country, City
WHERE Country.Capital = City.ID;

19.2 Trigger Concepts

CREATE TRIGGER Capital_bi
  BEFORE INSERT
  ON Capital
  FOR EACH ROW
    SET NEW.Population = 
      IF(NEW.Population < 0, 0, TRUNCATE(NEW.Population,-3));

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Capital;
CREATE TABLE Capital
SELECT Country.Name AS Country, City.Name AS Capital,
City.Population
FROM Country, City
WHERE Country.Capital = City.ID;
delimiter //
CREATE TRIGGER Capital_bi
  BEFORE INSERT
  ON Capital
  FOR EACH ROW
       SET NEW.Population = 
         IF(NEW.Population < 0, 0, TRUNCATE(NEW.Population,-3));
//
delimiter ;

INSERT INTO Capital VALUES
('CountryA','CityA',-39),
('CountryB','CityB',123456);

SELECT * FROM Capital
WHERE Country IN ('CountryA','CountryB');

19.3 Creating a Trigger

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Capital;
CREATE TABLE Capital
SELECT Country.Name AS Country, City.Name AS Capital,
City.Population
FROM Country, City
WHERE Country.Capital = City.ID;

delimiter //
CREATE TRIGGER Capital_bu
  BEFORE UPDATE
  ON Capital
  FOR EACH ROW
  BEGIN
    SET @country = OLD.Country;
    SET @capital_old = OLD.Capital;
    SET @capital_new = NEW.Capital;
 END;
//

delimiter ;
UPDATE Capital SET Capital = 'Washington D.C.'
WHERE Country = 'United States';

SELECT @country AS Country, @capital_old AS 'Old capital',
@capital_new AS 'New capital';

19.6 Destroying a Trigger

DROP TRIGGER Capital.Capital_bi;
